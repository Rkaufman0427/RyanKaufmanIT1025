### Internet Architecture
IP address is a shorter way of saying “Internet Protocol address.” IP addresses are the numbers assigned
to computer network interfaces. Although we use names to refer to the things we seek on the Internet,
such as www.example.org, computers translate these names into numerical addresses so they can
send data to the right location. So when you send an email, visit a web site, or participate in a video
conference, your computer sends data packets to the IP address of the other end of the connection
and receives packets destined for its own IP address.
Over the past year, major content providers and access networks have started offering IPv6 services to
ordinary Internet users. Because IPv6 is so much larger than IPv4, it should last us considerably longer
than the 30 years IPv4 has given us so far. But just how large is IPv6? IPv6 is significantly bigger than IPv4. Compared to IPv4’s 32-bit address space of four billion addresses, IPv6 has a 128-bit address space, which is 340 undecillion addresses. That’s not a number you hear every day
