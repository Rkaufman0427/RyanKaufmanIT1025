### Internet Architecture
##### Internet Protocol
IP address is a shorter way of saying “Internet Protocol address.” IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Although we use names to refer to the things we seek on the Internet,such as www.example.org, computers translate these names into numerical addresses so they can send data to the right location. So when you send an email, visit a web site, or participate in a videoconference, your computer sends data packets to the IP address of the other end of the connection and receives packets destined for its own IP address.
Over the past year, major content providers and access networks have started offering IPv6 services toordinary Internet users. Because IPv6 is so much larger than IPv4, it should last us considerably longer than the 30 years IPv4 has given us so far. But just how large is IPv6? IPv6 is significantly bigger than IPv4. Compared to IPv4’s 32-bit address space of four billion addresses, IPv6 has a 128-bit address space, which is 340 undecillion addresses. That’s not a number you hear every day.
 As the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, ICANN allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world. (The “regions” of the Regional Internet Registries are roughly continental in size.) The RIRs then allocate smaller IP address blocks to ISPs and other network operators. From there,
the ISPs and other Internet operators assign the addresses to the individual Internet connections you are probably accustomed to.
##### TCP/IP
TCP/IP was developed by the US department of defense for the purpose of connecting government computer systems to each other through a global, fault tolerant, network.
The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in. In other words, the Client needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established. The Server only has to listen for connections and either accept them or reject them when they are initiated by a client. Once a connection through a TCP/IP port has been established between a TCP/IP client and a TCP/IP server, data can be sent in either direction exactly the same way that data is sent through any other type of port on a PC (serial, parallel, etc.). The only difference is that the data is sent across your network. The connection between a Client and a Server remains open until either the client or the server terminates the connection (i.e. hangs up the phone)
Layers are important to changing technology because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. So if new tech steps in it wont effect anything.
##### Internet Security
HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it relates to client-server model because is sends infortmation from a computer to a webserver over the public internet. The client has to send this over the server that they are using.
