### Executive Summary
In this lab we are going to learn more about programming. We will be using Python and W3schools again to bring our programming skills to the test.The topics are listed below and should be challenging.

### File Compression
Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files. In Windows, you work with zipped files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. Combine several files into a single zipped folder to more easily share a group of files. Basically you can send or share a smaller and less busy version of your work and takes less time to downlioad.
The original SVG file was at 81.9 kb and the new SVG Compressed Zip is now 34.8 KB. If you try and do this to a JPEG it might not change in size since it is already a smaller size.
### Object Oriented Concepts
A Class and an Object that would be at a fast food restaurant. The Class would be Customers and the Object would be food that would be sold.
Object = Sammy
Class = Shark
Abstraction = Def. of a Shark
Encapsulation = Swim (self)
Inheritance = A specific type of Shark
Another way to think of these terms are in the case of video games. The creator would have an idea for the game and would go through the abstraction process to define all the components of the game. Each component (such as avatars) would be defined in a class that would include all the attributes of an avatar (haircolor, clothes etc.) and the methods or things that an avatar can do. The creation of an avatar is creating an instance of the class which is an avatar object. The methods or things that an avatar can do are encapsulated in the methods of the class such as Run(), Jump() etc. If we needed another type of avatar that contained all the attributes and methods of the original avatar but with some additional attributes and methods the new type of avatar would inherit from the original avatar class.
### Python OOP
Swim and Be Awesome are the Methods and property this this example for Shark.
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. Also known as the __init__ method, it will be the first definition of a class.
Classes make it possible to create more than one object following the same pattern without creating each one from scratch.
This tutorial went through creating classes, instantiating objects, initializing attributes with the constructor method, and working with more than one object of the same class.
### Date, Information and Knowledge
##### Rational Data
Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent.  For example, a sales order of computers is a piece of data.  Data can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is numeric, the result of a measurement, count, or some other mathematical calculation. Qualitative data is descriptive. “Ruby Red,” the color of a 2013 Ford Focus, is an example of qualitative data. A number can be qualitative too: if I tell you my favorite number is 5, that is qualitative data because it is descriptive, not the result of a measurement or mathematical calculation.
Information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose.  For example, monthly sales calculated from the collected daily sales data for the past year are information.  Information typically involves the manipulation of raw data to obtain an indication of magnitude, trends, in patterns in the data for a purpose.
Knowledge in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.  For example, the conceived relationship between the quality of goods and the sales is knowledge.  Knowledge can be viewed as information that facilitates action.
Customers and Orders give you information and data.
Primary key would be the customer number.
Customers and Orders would go together because Customers place orders.
I would say a good foreign key would be number of items ordered.
You need dates in a order table to help with breaking down what they order everyday.
##### Big Data
Volume: It represents the amount of data and is one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”. This refers to the mass quantity of data that organizations have been trying to harness and to improve decision making across the enterprise.
Velocity: This characteristic represents the motion of the data. It has changed the mindset of the past that the data of yesterday, past hour or minute is the recent data. The data movement is now almost real time and the update window has reduced to the fraction of a second. Because of this real-time nature of data creation, enterprises have invested a lot to develop Big Data solutions which could incorporate streaming data into business processes and decision making.
Variety: It defines different types of data and data resources. The world has moved beyond the traditional means of structured data like bank statement which included information like date, amount, and time. New categories have been added to the list of data types. Unstructured data i.e. the data that does not have a well-defined set of rules, for example, Twitter feeds, audio files, MRI images, web pages, web logs has contributed immensely to the rise of Big Data.
Veracity: It can be termed as the trustworthiness of the data i.e. calculation of the noises, biases and abnormality in the data. We may also define veracity as the level of reliability associated with certain types of data.
A common traditional approach is to use a sample of the large dataset which could fit in memory. But with the arrival of Big Data, processing tools like Hadoop can now be used to run many exploratory data analysis tasks on full datasets, without sampling. Just write a MapReduce job, PIG or HIVE script, launch it directly on Hadoop over the full dataset, and get the results right back to your laptop.
 
### Conclusion
This lab was very tricky especially when it came to the Shark Diagram and how we in hindsite are buidling our own avatar. THis has a lot to do with the "Gaming" side of IT which I love. I felt like that portion was not in order because when I saw the  working they used I had no idead how or why you placed said words. I eventually figured it in thte third part of the lab. Overall a fun lab I would just lake to start puting some coding together.
