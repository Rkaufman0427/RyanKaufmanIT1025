### File Compression
Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files. In Windows, you work with zipped files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. Combine several files into a single zipped folder to more easily share a group of files. Basically you can send or share a smaller and less busy version of your work and takes less time to downlioad.
The original SVG file was at 81.9 kb and the new SVG Compressed Zip is now 34.8 KB. If you try and do this to a JPEG it might not change in size since it is already a smaller size.
### Object Oriented Concepts
A Class and an Object that would be at a fast food restaurant. The Class would be Customers and the Object would be food that would be sold.
Object = Sammy
Class = Shark
Abstraction = Def. of a Shark
Encapsulation = Swim (self)
Inheritance = A specific type of Shark
Another way to think of these terms are in the case of video games. The creator would have an idea for the game and would go through the abstraction process to define all the components of the game. Each component (such as avatars) would be defined in a class that would include all the attributes of an avatar (haircolor, clothes etc.) and the methods or things that an avatar can do. The creation of an avatar is creating an instance of the class which is an avatar object. The methods or things that an avatar can do are encapsulated in the methods of the class such as Run(), Jump() etc. If we needed another type of avatar that contained all the attributes and methods of the original avatar but with some additional attributes and methods the new type of avatar would inherit from the original avatar class.
