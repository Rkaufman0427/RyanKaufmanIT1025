### File Compression
Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files. In Windows, you work with zipped files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. Combine several files into a single zipped folder to more easily share a group of files. Basically you can send or share a smaller and less busy version of your work and takes less time to downlioad.
The original SVG file was at 81.9 kb and the new SVG Compressed Zip is now 34.8 KB. If you try and do this to a JPEG it might not change in size since it is already a smaller size.
