### Data, Information and Knowledge
##### Relational Data
Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent.  For example, a sales order of computers is a piece of data.  Data can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is numeric, the result of a measurement, count, or some other mathematical calculation. Qualitative data is descriptive. “Ruby Red,” the color of a 2013 Ford Focus, is an example of qualitative data. A number can be qualitative too: if I tell you my favorite number is 5, that is qualitative data because it is descriptive, not the result of a measurement or mathematical calculation.
Information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose.  For example, monthly sales calculated from the collected daily sales data for the past year are information.  Information typically involves the manipulation of raw data to obtain an indication of magnitude, trends, in patterns in the data for a purpose.
Knowledge in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.  For example, the conceived relationship between the quality of goods and the sales is knowledge.  Knowledge can be viewed as information that facilitates action.
