### Python IDLE
The differance between the Shell and the File Editor in the Idle is that Shell runs code one instruction at a time and File Editor where you can type complete programs into.
##### Code Examples
Some code examples are a variable a variable is a box that can store a single value, Example: Sapm=42 now when you type spam it will hold the value of 42. The reason they use the words spam, bacon and eggs stems from the Monty Phython skit "Spam". An assignment statement is a statement that assigns a value to a name (Variable), Examples: +, =, /. A Fucntion is a block of code hich only runs when it is called and you must put "def" as  keyword to make it a function, Example: def my_function() then print ("Hello from a function"). Three Data types are Integers which are whole number values like -2, 30 these are also referred to as Ints. Next we have the Floating Point Numbers which are decimals like 2.13, 2.63 and are also called Floats. Finally we have strings which are text values and must begin and end in quotes which would look like this 'Alice'.
### Graphics
##### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
When small images lose quality when you enlarge them. It's because they're made up of thousands—sometimes even millions—of tiny little pixels. The word for this type of image is raster. Vector graphics are quite different from raster. You can make them any size, big or small, without losing quality. In the example below, the image has been enlarged, but there's no pixelation—not even a little bit.
