### Lucidchart
I found my experiancewith the Luchid Chart was actually pretty easy, It sort of reminded me of the program we used to make the LOGO's. I like that you can share it and have your peers review and comment on it. I like how easy it was to design the flow chart but would have been easier to see an example of what you actually wanted.
### Introduction to Networking
##### Data Transmission
The following terms match said definitions 
Packet: Unit of Data, and the actual defintion is The fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet. When a host (PC, workstation, server, printer, etc.) intends to send a message to another host (for example, your PC sends a request to YouTube to open a video), it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets. Each packet has the sender’s address, the destination address, a sequence number, and a piece of the overall message to be sent. Different packets in a single message can take a variety of routes to the destination and they can arrive at different times. For this reason the sequence number is used to reassemble the packets in the proper order at the destination.
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address, and the actual defintion is When a message’s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. This can result in packets being sent on different routes to their destination. After the packets arrive they are re-assembled into the original message for the recipient. For more details on packet-switching.
IP Address: Unique identifying number, and the actual definition is Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address.
DNS: Directory of IP address common names, and the actual definition is DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet.
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate, and the actual definition is A protocol is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another.
These terms all need eachother to in able to comunicate with another computer. They all seem like they are what helps with communications.
##### Networking Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a switch is intelligent and a hub is no. A switch can also connect to specific devices that are connected to it and a hub will share with all devices connected to it.
The benefit of a Router over a switch and hub is that a router can forward data from one network to another over the internet and Switches and Hubs can not do this. The router is basically a building block for networks.
##### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is when a central hub or switch fails in which all would be affected and the entire network goes down. The topologies that experiance this are Star, Ring, Bus and Mesh.
Inrfastructure Topology: Is wired and wireless devices that are extended to wired LAN to include wireless devices such as laptops, tablets and cell phones. The wireless accessport is a bridge to the wireless network and the wired network. 
Wireless Mesh Topology: Devices are interconnected to eachother but are wireless only all take alot of wiring, money and is very time consuming to set up. Has many wirelss accessports.
I would say the the Wireless Mesh would be the best although it does cost more and is very difficult to set up it works very well even if one of the routers goes down it will still work. 
##### Network Design
##### NSA/CSS
THe NAS's role in the US Cyber Security is that they are constantly monitoring outside "Actors" of countries trying to steal peoples identitys or trying to get the upper hand on secret information. NAS monitors these avenues to make sure this does not happen. They provide intelligance support to our Armed Forces and provide wireless and wired secure communications to our warfighters and others in uniform no matter where they are, whether traveling through Afghanistan in a Humvee, diving beneath the sea, or flying into outer space. Also protecting our weapons systems. They are the kings of cyber security and provide the means to combat any cyber threat.
### Cybersecurity and Encryption
##### Information Systems Security
If I was an Amazon.com chat person I would make sure the confidentiality is intactby making sure the person I am talking to is the actual user of the account, usually with passwords and personal information before I continued. Need to make sure Integrity is in use to make sure no one is trying to hack this persons Amazon account to order things or steal their credit card info. Availibility I would need to be availible 24/7 incase a customer needs to access their account and can not get in especially if it is an emergency.
##### Cryptography
Three daily tasks that need authentication are checking my bank account, logging into my Xbox and opening my phone. All three of theses could use the same ways to gain access, you could have facial recognition which my phone can do for my bank account and phone entry and my Xbox would use the Kinect to do this. All three could have a numeric password which all currently have and finally a security question to gain access.
ACLs are simple to understand and maintain, but there are several drawbacks. The primary drawback is that each information resource is managed separately, so if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. And as the number of users and resources increase, ACLs become harder to maintain,
This has led to an improved method of access control, called role-based access control, or RBAC. With RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access. This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administration and, by extension, improving security.
The interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key is when a you send a plaintext message which is then encrypted with a public key. The ciphered text is transmitted through the communication channel and the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message and then read the plain text.
We need public key cryptography so it makes it nearly impossible for some one trying to intercept information will not be able to figure it out. Only the 2 sharing the information can figure it out.
My Cipher was GO TRIBE which turned into TB GEVOR which had a shift or 13 letters.
In the Frequency Fingerprint Exploration I noticed it was pretty dead on to what I typed. Pretty crazy to think that what we type actually has its own cipher to it I think it would still be the same in other languages you just have to know their alphabet.
Polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher that uses the same plaintext letter but then you use a shift word which is used to create a cipher in a cipher and the longer the shift word the harder it is to break the cipher.
When I did the Polyalphabetic Exploration and shift word I noticed that my sentence "the indians are going to the world series" and my shift word "baseball" made the cipher pretty hard to crack. I even had the word "the" in twice and it was spelled differently twice.
##### Brute-Force
tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Nothing stops a cryptanalyst from guessing one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the next key if they didn’t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective against the Caesar cipher, you shouldn’t actually use the Caesar cipher to encrypt secret information but Kerckoff's principle states that a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext.
