### Lucidchart
I found my experiancewith the Luchid Chart was actually pretty easy, It sort of reminded me of the program we used to make the LOGO's. I like that you can share it and have your peers review and comment on it. I like how easy it was to design the flow chart but would have been easier to see an example of what you actually wanted.
### Introduction to Networking
##### Data Transmission
The following terms match said definitions 
Packet: Unit of Data, and the actual defintion is The fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet. When a host (PC, workstation, server, printer, etc.) intends to send a message to another host (for example, your PC sends a request to YouTube to open a video), it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets. Each packet has the sender’s address, the destination address, a sequence number, and a piece of the overall message to be sent. Different packets in a single message can take a variety of routes to the destination and they can arrive at different times. For this reason the sequence number is used to reassemble the packets in the proper order at the destination.
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address, and the actual defintion is When a message’s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. This can result in packets being sent on different routes to their destination. After the packets arrive they are re-assembled into the original message for the recipient. For more details on packet-switching.
IP Address: Unique identifying number, and the actual definition is Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address.
DNS: Directory of IP address common names, and the actual definition is DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet.
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate, and the actual definition is A protocol is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another.
These terms all need eachother to in able to comunicate with another computer. They all seem like they are what helps with communications.
##### Networking Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a switch is intelligent and a hub is no. A switch can also connect to specific devices that are connected to it and a hub will share with all devices connected to it.
The benefit of a Router over a switch and hub is that a router can forward data from one network to another over the internet and Switches and Hubs can not do this. The router is basically a building block for networks.
