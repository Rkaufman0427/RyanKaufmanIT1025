### Executive Summary
##### In this Lab we are gong to learn about Hardware and Data representation and how it is used to help computers store date. LAb 2 will give us a break down on the five components that make up hardware: hardware, software, data, people and process. We also learn how they help with the inut and output of data and information to the mother board. We will also be learning how binary code works and how to read it.

### Hardware
##### Hard Disk Performance
###### The differance between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive. Mechanical latencies are measured in millisecond, include both seek time and rotational latency. Seek Time is measured defines the amount of time it takes a hard drive’s read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk. While transfer rates are generally described in megabytes per second (MBps). Thr fastest high-performance drives were capable of an average latency of less than 3ms, an average seek time of between 4 and 7ms and maximum data transfer rates in the region of 50 and 60MBps for EIDE and SCSI-based drives respectively. Note the degree to which these maximum DTRs are below the bandwidths of the current versions of the drive’s interfaces – Ultra ATA/100 and UltraSCSI 160 – which are rated at 100MBps and 160MBps respectively. These speeds are alot faster than that of of Hard drive latency.

##### Solid State Hard Drives 
###### There are many differances between Solid State Hard Drives and Traditional Hard Drives. SSD do not have any moving parts like the Traditional Hard Drives and are less likely to get affected from dust or particles that could clog the spinning parts of the Traditional Hard Drive. Traditional hard drives also take a lot longer to read as they need time to spinning for the head to read sectors of the platter, sometimes we have to wait for spin up time. Once the disk is spinning, the head must seek the correct place on the disk, and from there the disk must spin just enough so that the correct data is read. If data is spread over different parts of the disk (fragmented) then this operation is repeated until all the data has been read or written. With SSD the data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. It is then accessed almost instantaneously using unique system-wide addresses. 

##### RAM Explained-Random Access Memory
###### Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster, if you have low RAM then the computer will read the rest of the date off of the hard drive and this take more time than the computer taking the information from the RAM. So it goes hard drive to RAM to the CPU but if you have a high amount of RAM it can go RAM to CPU and wont have to go back to the hard drive. RAMs also transfer in MB/S which is way faster than that of a hard drive but be ahware RAMs only work on a mother board they are fitted for. These are DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4.
