## Executive Summary
##### In this Lab we are gong to learn about Hardware and Data representation and how it is used to help computers store date. LAb 2 will give us a break down on the five components that make up hardware: hardware, software, data, people and process. We also learn how they help with the inut and output of data and information to the mother board. We will also be learning how binary code works and how to read it.

## Hardware: 
##### Hard Drives and Memory
###### The differance between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive. Mechanical latencies are measured in millisecond, include both seek time and rotational latency. Seek Time is measured defines the amount of time it takes a hard drive’s read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk. While transfer rates are generally described in megabytes per second (MBps). Thr fastest high-performance drives were capable of an average latency of less than 3ms, an average seek time of between 4 and 7ms and maximum data transfer rates in the region of 50 and 60MBps for EIDE and SCSI-based drives respectively. Note the degree to which these maximum DTRs are below the bandwidths of the current versions of the drive’s interfaces – Ultra ATA/100 and UltraSCSI 160 – which are rated at 100MBps and 160MBps respectively. These speeds are alot faster than that of of Hard drive latency.

#### Solid State Hard Drives 
###### There are many differances between Solid State Hard Drives and Traditional Hard Drives. SSD do not have any moving parts like the Traditional Hard Drives and are less likely to get affected from dust or particles that could clog the spinning parts of the Traditional Hard Drive. Traditional hard drives also take a lot longer to read as they need time to spinning for the head to read sectors of the platter, sometimes we have to wait for spin up time. Once the disk is spinning, the head must seek the correct place on the disk, and from there the disk must spin just enough so that the correct data is read. If data is spread over different parts of the disk (fragmented) then this operation is repeated until all the data has been read or written. With SSD the data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. It is then accessed almost instantaneously using unique system-wide addresses. 

#### RAM Explained-Random Access Memory
###### The differance between the 32 bit and 64 bit RAMs is that a 32 bit RAM can hold up to 4 gigabytes of data. The 64 bit can hold up to 16 Exabytes of data. With the 32 bit you will certainly run slower as the CPU with have to run slower to pull from the hard drive but with the 64 bit you will have basically an unlimited amount of memory which will in turn run faster. 
###### Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster, if you have low RAM then the computer will read the rest of the date off of the hard drive and this take more time than the computer taking the information from the RAM. So it goes hard drive to RAM to the CPU but if you have a high amount of RAM it can go RAM to CPU and wont have to go back to the hard drive. RAMs also transfer in MB/S which is way faster than that of a hard drive but be ahware RAMs only work on a mother board they are fitted for. These are DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4.

#### ALU and the Control Unit 
###### The ALU and the Control Unit interaction is as described, the ALU performs all the mathmatical operations inside a CPU and do do functions such as additon, subtraction and comparisons. For instance the Control Unit recieves the intructions from the RAM and then tells the ALU the type of operation to perform. The ALU can send flags to the Control Unit and then can go through a register to store number onto until it cn transfer from the set wire to the enable wire and then to the bus.

#### CPU, Input & Output 
###### Im at a grocery check out at a store. First I need to input the data which would be the barcode of the product I am purchasing. That barcode will send binary information from the barcode to be stored  in the memory and the processed from the CPU of the register. It will then it output that data in to a picture or a name of the product and price for that product on the screen for you to purchase. It does this process so fast you do not even notice what is going on. 

#### Logic Gates and Circuits
###### A truth table can turn inputs into output or ones into zeros and zeros into ones. We can summarize how they work very quickly and simply by writing this in a table form or Truth Table. So a NAND Table would take Input 1 with a 0 and Input 2 with 0 and would have an Output of 1. The table for the NAND and the AND have exactly reversed Outputs. if you have outputs for the NAND of 1,1,1,0 the AND would be 0,0,0,1.

#### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
###### IEEE an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity, is the world's largest technical professional society. It is designed to seserve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization. There are five areas of ethical focus and they are Accountability, Value Alignment, Explainability, Fairness and User Data Rights. By adopting and practicing the five focal areas covered in this document, designers and developers can become more ethically aware, mitigate biases within these systems, and instill responsibility and accountability in those who work with AI. As much of what we do related to artificial intelligence is new territory for all of us, individuals and groups will need to further define criteria and metrics for evaluation to better allow for the detection and mitigation of any issues.

### Data Representation
#### Numeric Conversions
###### The differance between Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal numbers are the way you calculate them. Binary you use the power of 10 and convert numbers into binary code. Decimal you convert binary code in to numbers using the power of 10. Hexadecimals you use the power of 16 to covert numbers and letters in to binary code.
##### Hexadecimal Color Representation
